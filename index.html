      	<p>One of the major benefits that one can reap from being involved in Scouting, is the opportunity to participate in numerous community events.  My boys and I participated in food drives, park cleanups, tree plantings, as well as service to the church that chartered their troops.</p>

      	<h2>STEM in Scouting</h2>
      </header>
      <section>
        <p>STEM education is all around us in the news. Parents want STEM education. Educational districts are anxious to train this country's next batch of leaders in engineering. What is STEM? STEM is an acronym that stands for Science Technology Engineering and Math. In Scouting, we have merit badges that the older Boy Scouts work to earn. These merit badges often provide an opportunity for boys to learn about a potential career.</p>

      <section>
        <p>Eagle Scout projects can range from the rehab of a church playground to the placement of colorful, fun ceiling tiles in a nursing home. Boys work hard to gather volunteers and accomplish various good works. Boys have even been know to rehabilitate a cemetary that has fallen into disrepair.</p>

        <h2>It's Magic</h2>
      </header>
      <section>
        <p>The magic of Scouting is that it is so much fun while learning about getting along with others, learning about the outdoors, and most importantly, learning about leadership.  It's like the magic trick you can't understand unless you're the magician. You never really see or know how beneficial it is to boys and their families, unless you are right in the middle of it.</p>
        <p>Scouting can really bring a family together in cooperation on outings, campouts, service projects, etc. Young men learn to lead and follow.</p>

    	<section>
    		<p>Our local Scouts go to camp at Boxwell Scout Reservation. There are many wonderful Scout reservations around the country that go from very expensive to visit, to very affordable. It all depends upon the adventure you choose. Sea Base is a pricier activity than most. </p>
